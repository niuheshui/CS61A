Q5: Shuffle
Define a function shuffle that takes a sequence with an even number of elements (cards) and creates a new list that interleaves the elements of the first half with the elements of the second half.

To interleave two sequences s0 and s1 is to create a new sequence such that the new sequence contains (in this order) the first element of s0, the first element of s1, the second element of s0, the second element of s1, and so on.

Note: If you're running into an issue where the special heart / diamond / spades / clubs symbols are erroring in the doctests, feel free to copy paste the below doctests into your file as these don't use the special characters and should not give an "illegal multibyte sequence" error.
